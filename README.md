A tool for importing CBL reading lists into Mylar as series

This tool relies on the following software:
- mylar/mylar3
- jessebraham/comicvine-search 
- Comicvine (personal API key required)

Credit to flips for his original script, which I used as a basis for my own.

Features:
- Read, optimise & maintain a list of series found in one or more CBL files
- Search for comicvine series matches. Ability to blacklist & prefer specific publishers when finding matches.
- Check series status in Mylar. Option to add series to Mylar.
